# Virtualization in Bioinformatics

_These platforms provide a web service,ususally free, computing power and storage on a server connected to Internet, and it can be an undertaking to update and maintain such services over time.
Increasing data volumes in molecular biology from eg; parallel sequencing, makes it infeasiable to offer such data and compute-intensive services online._

They allow us to tinker and explore problems easier resulting in better and efficient solutions.

# Types of Virtualizations

1.OS Virtualizationâ€”aka Virtual Machines

2.Application-Server Virtualization
 
3.Application Virtualization

4.Administrative Virtualization

5.Network Virtualization

6.Hardware Virtualization

7.Storage Virtualization

# Advantages

1. It is cheaper
2. Keeps costs predictable
3. Reduces workload
4. Offers a better uptime
5. Allows for faster deployment of resources
6. Promotes digital entrepreneurship
7. It provides energy saving

# Disadvantages

1. Can have a high cost of implementation
2. Still  has limitations
3. Creates a security risk
4. Creates an availability issue
5. Takes time
6. Requires several links in a chain that must work together cohesively

# Virtualization vs. Containerisation

Virtualization reproduces an entire computer in hardware that runs an entire OS. This runs one application. 
While Containers take an alternative approach. They share an underlying OS kernel, only running the application and the things it depends on, like software libraries and environment variables. This makes containers smaller and faster to deploy.
This simply means Virtualization is used for whole operating systems, while containerizations is used for individual applications.
